This repo is AFFiNE official website and blog source code.

## How to publish blog

The new blog source uses AFFiNE - public workspace: [https://app.affine.pro/public-workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_](https://app.affine.pro/public-workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_)

You can use AFFiNE to write your article, contact [ShortCipher](https://github.com/ShortCipher5) to request permissions for the AFFiNE Blog Workspace.
