[AFFiNE's community](https://community.affine.pro/) site is already online! We welcome everyone to find and share noteworthy information! 

This is a place for AFFiNE lovers to focus. You can find all the news about AFFiNE and share what you want to say here. Next, I'll give a quick overview of how to use this community!


# Part 1: Why do we need the new community page?

First of all, our previous blog website did not have a comment section, so there was no way for people to communicate with us about the content of our articles. Now we have added **'like' and 'comment' functions to the community where you can post tips, ideas and suggestions**. We want to make the most of the value of our articles and really help people and solve problems.

Then, we collected **a lot of feedback and suggestions on Discord/Telegram previously**. For this information, we would like to have **a place to record it and provide a channel where people can communicate with each other**, and everyone can easily find it. The community uses a posts model so that anyone interested in the feature can post their thoughts at any time, and we can schedule subsequent features better (which would be more efficient than going through chat logs).

Finally, there are many content sites and feedback is scattered at the moment. So we hope we can have **a central place to sink our content**.

# Part 2: How do you join the community quickly?
