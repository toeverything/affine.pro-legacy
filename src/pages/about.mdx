## The Philosophy of AFFiNE

People need better building blocks for future applications. And it should not be so hard to develop collaborative, transferable, smart spreadsheets or block editors.

Timothy Berners-Lee once taught us about the idea of the semantic web, where all the data can be interpreted in any form while the "truth" is kept. This gives our best image of an ideal knowledge base by far, that sorting of information, planning of project and goals as well as creating of knowledge can be all together.

We have witnessed waves of paradigm shift so many times. At first, everything was noted on office-like apps or DSL like LaTeX, then we found todo-list apps and WYSIWYG markdown editors better for writing and planning.

Finally, here comes Notion and Miro, who take advantage of the idea of blocks to further liberate our creativity. It is all perfect... without waste operations and redundant information. And, we insist that privacy first should always be given by default. That's why we are making AFFiNE.
