- Fixed: When the user presses the shift key to draw consecutive straight lines, the starting point of the second line now coincides with the ending point of the first line;
- Fixed: Tag-app caused page crashes during use;
- Fixed: The page view did not accurately recognize the mouse selection;
- Fixed: After switching pages, the behavior of selection feature did not meet expectations;
- Fixed: AFFiNE was prompting a window during the installation process indicating that the installation has failed;
- Fixed: Alignment of page styles with design drawings;
- Fixed: In paper mode, no background colors could be added to the text;
- Fixed: The GitBook URL now uses AFFiNE's domain name;
- Fixed: The GitHub ReadMe badge has been updated;
- Fixed: Low priority console warnings where React does not recognize isDisabled.
