- Fixed: The top toolbar right setting center icon shows the wrong style when open;
- Fixed: When selecting a color from the left toolbar "pencil" in board mode, the bubble style is wrong when the mouse hovers;
- Fixed: When deleting a selected block group, the shapes within the group cannot be deleted;
- Fixed: Dragging the block left, and right will bring up two delete buttons in board mode;
- Fixed: The color card of the tag system needs to be aligned with the design;
- Fixed: The tags that have been added to the article can be modified by popping up an edit box when the mouse is clicked;
- Fixed: Wrong position of the line under the text when the mouse hovers to wake up the tag system;
- Fixed: The default value of "Field Title" of the tag-added card is set;
