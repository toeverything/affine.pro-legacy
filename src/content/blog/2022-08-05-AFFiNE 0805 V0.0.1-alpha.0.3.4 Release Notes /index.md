**Thank you very much for your attention to AFFiNE! Some exciting changes in AFFiNE are as follows:**

### **Bug Fixes**

In our continued effort to make AFFiNE the most reliable all in one knowledge base 展开, fixing bugs is always our main concern. Here's our work in the last few days:

- Fixed: In Kanban view, dragging a card with the mouse will trigger a selection and bring up a tag edit box;
- Fixed: Adding a child of a page in page-tree in doc mode will throw an error in the page;
- Fixed: User changes in the Kanban view are not synchronized when converting to text;
- Fixed: When you add a tag to a block in an article and then hover over another block to add a tag, the tag edit card displays the tag record;
- Fixed: In page mode, the block group toolbar and the mode switch button on the page are blocked from each other;
- Fixed: In the board mode, when dragging one of the block groups into another block group, the first displayed indicator line will always be there;
- Fixed: The 'ctrl + A' shortcut cannot be used in the input box of the edit panel of the tag app (Note: 'ctrl+a' key combination is a select-all shortcut).

AFFiNE is currently in the early alpha stage with limited access, and public early access will be available in the autumn of 2022.
